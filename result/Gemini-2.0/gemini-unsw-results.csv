opt-1,1,"To determine the convexity or concavity of the function \( h(x_1, x_2) = \frac{x_1^2}{x_2} \) on the region \( \Omega_0 = \{ (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_2 > 0 \} \), we need to compute the Hessian matrix and analyze its properties.

First, we find the first-order partial derivatives:
\[
\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_1} = \frac{2x_1}{x_2}, \quad \frac{\partial h}{\partial x_2} = -\frac{x_1^2}{x_2^2}.
\]

Next, we find the second-order partial derivatives:
\[
\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x_1^2} = \frac{2}{x_2}, \quad
\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x_2^2} = \frac{2x_1^2}{x_2^3}, \quad
\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} = \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} = -\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2}.
\]

The Hessian matrix is then given by:
\[
H(x_1, x_2) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{2}{x_2} & -\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2} \\
-\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2} & \frac{2x_1^2}{x_2^3}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To determine the definiteness of the Hessian, we need to examine its leading principal minors. The first leading principal minor is \( \frac{2}{x_2} \), which is positive since \( x_2 > 0 \).

The determinant of the Hessian is:
\[
\det(H) = \left( \frac{2}{x_2} \right) \left( \frac{2x_1^2}{x_2^3} \right) - \left( -\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2} \right)^2 = \frac{4x_1^2}{x_2^4} - \frac{4x_1^2}{x_2^4} = 0.
\]

Since the determinant is 0 and the first leading principal minor is positive, the Hessian is positive semidefinite.

This indicates that the function \( h(x_1, x_2) \) is convex on \( \Omega_0 \). It is not strictly convex since the determinant is zero. Therefore, the function is convex.

-- The function \( h(x_1, x_2) = \frac{x_1^2}{x_2} \) on the region \( \Omega_0 = \{ (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_2 > 0 \} \) is convex, but not strictly convex, because the Hessian matrix is positive semidefinite and not positive definite.
","\textbf{Solution.} The gradient and the Hessian of \( h \) are given by

\[
\nabla h(x_1, x_2) = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2x_1}{x_2} \\
-\frac{x_1^2}{x_2^2}
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\nabla^2 h(x_1, x_2) = \begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2}{x_2} & -\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2} \\
-\frac{2x_1}{x_2^2} & \frac{2x_1^2}{x_2^3}
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Then,
\[
\mathrm{tr}(\nabla^2 h(x_1, x_2)) = \frac{2}{x_2} + \frac{2x_1^2}{x_2^3} > 0 \quad \text{on } \Omega_0,
\]

and
\[
\det(\nabla^2 h(x_1, x_2)) = \frac{4x_1^2}{x_2^4} - \frac{4x_1^2}{x_2^4} = 0,
\]

implying that one of the eigenvalues is zero and the other is positive. Hence, \( \nabla^2 h(x_1, x_2) \) is positive semidefinite on \( \Omega_0 \), and \( h \) is a convex function on \( \Omega_0 \).

If \( a_{ii}a_{jj} < 0 \), then \( a_{ii} \) and \( a_{jj} \) have opposite signs.

Then \( x^T A x = a_{ii} \) and \( y^T A y = a_{jj} \). Since \( a_{ii}a_{jj} < 0 \), it follows that \( x^T A x \) and \( y^T A y \) have opposite signs.

For the former scenario, \( e_i^T A e_i < 0 \) and \( e_j^T A e_j > 0 \). By the definition, \( A \) is an indefinite matrix.

The spline is a piecewise cubic polynomial. It is not a cubic over the whole interval \([0.5,1]\), but just on each subinterval \([t_{i},t_{i+1}]\). Simpson's rule requires an even number of intervals, so we need to add the midpoint to each sub-interval, get its value using the cubic spline and then integrate each cubic piece using Simpson's rule. This will give the exact integral of the cubic spline as  

\[\int_{0.5}^{1}r(s)ds=\sum_{i=7}^{12}\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}}r(s)\,ds=\sum_{i=7}^{1 2}\frac{1}{72}\left(r_{i}+4r_{i+\frac{1}{2}}+r_{i+1}\right),\]

fin-4-ii-c,54,"When comparing integration errors between a standard Monte Carlo method and a method using a ""low-discrepancy"" point set, the key difference lies in the convergence rate. Standard Monte Carlo methods typically have a convergence rate of \( O(N^{-1/2}) \), where \( N \) is the number of samples, due to the central limit theorem, regardless of the dimension \( d \). In contrast, methods using ""low-discrepancy"" point sets, often called quasi-Monte Carlo methods, can achieve convergence rates closer to \( O((\log N)^d/N) \) as indicated by the Koksma-Hlawka inequality, where the error is bounded by the product of the total variation of the integrand and the star discrepancy of the point set. Thus, for high-dimensional problems, quasi-Monte Carlo methods can offer significantly faster convergence and reduced integration errors compared to standard Monte Carlo methods, especially when the integrand has bounded variation.  ","**Answer:** The Monte-Carlo method has root mean square (RMS) error of the form  

\[\frac{\sigma(f)}{N^{\frac{1}{2}}}.\]  

The key advantage is that this does not depend directly on the dimension \(d\) (the variance \(\sigma^{2}(f)\) of the function does depend on the dimension \(d\)). The disadvantage is that the convergence rate of \(O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}})\) is slow.  

For ""low-discrepancy"" point sets, the Koksma-Hlawka inequality shows that the error for numerical integration is bounded by  

\[V(f)\ c_{d}\ \frac{(\log N)^{d-1}}{N}.\]  

For small dimensions \(d\) and large \(N\), this behaves like \(O\left(\frac{1}{N}\right)\) which should be better than the Monte-Carlo method. However for modest/higher values of \(d\), the \(\log(N)^{d-1}\) term cannot be treated as a constant, unless \(N\) is very very large (so large that computation is unrealistic).

B) The implication is that \( (\log N)^{d-1} \) is significantly larger than \( N^{1/2} \) for this high-dimensional problem. Specifically, \( (\log N)^{d-1} \) is approximately \( 10^{41} \) times larger than \( N^{-1/2} \), suggesting that the error bound for a ""low-discrepancy"" point set, which is proportional to \( (\log N)^{d-1}/N \), will be much larger than the error bound for a standard Monte Carlo method, which is proportional to \( N^{-1/2} \). This means that using a ""low-discrepancy"" point set satisfying the given condition may not provide a benefit over standard Monte Carlo in this case, and might even be worse, due to the large dimensionality.  ","**Answer:**  

A) For \(d=20\) and \(N=10^{20}\):  

\[(\log N)^{d-1}=(\log 10^{20})^{19}=4\times 10^{31},\qquad N^{\frac{1}{2}}=10^{10}.\]

For \(d=20\) and \(N=10^{20}\) this is nowhere near being true, indicating that for these values the Monte-Carlo method would be preferable.

Let \(g\) be a function which approximates \(f^{2}\) such that \(\mathbb{E}[g]\) is known analytically. Then, using the linearity of the expectation,  

\[\text{Var}[f]=\mathbb{E}[f^{2}-g+g]-\mu^{2}=\mathbb{E}[f^{2}-g]+\mathbb{E}[g]-\mu^{2}.\]  

If \(g\) is a good approximation of \(f^{2}\), so that \(\sigma(f^{2}-g)\ll\sigma(f^{2})\) (variance reduction), then using a numerical method to approximate \(\mathbb{E}[f^{2}-g]\) and adding \(\mathbb{E}[g]-\mu^{2}\) should produce a more accurate estimate of \(\text{Var}[f]\) than numerically calculating \(\mathbb{E}[f^{2}]\) directly.

\[
y_j = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \hat{y}_k e^{i 2\pi jk / N},

we can rewrite \( e^{i 2\pi jk / N} \) as 
\[
\cos(2\pi jk/N) + i \sin(2\pi jk/N).
\]
Separating the sum into real and imaginary parts, and using the property \( \hat{y}_{N-k} = \overline{\hat{y}_k} \), we can express \( y_j \) as a sum of cosine and sine terms. By comparing this expression with the desired form
\[
y_j = a_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} [a_k \cos(2\pi k t_j / T) + b_k \sin(2\pi k t_j / T)],

\[

\]
Since the \( y_j \) are real numbers, the imaginary part in the above expression is 0 and we have
\[
y_j = \frac{\text{Re}(\hat{y}_0)}{N} + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \left[ \frac{2 \text{Re}(\hat{y}_k)}{N} \cos(2\pi jk/N) - \frac{2 \text{Im}(\hat{y}_k)}{N} \sin(2\pi jk/N) \right].

Since \( N = 2n \) is even, for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \), we also have:
\[
\cos(2\pi jk/N) + \cos(2\pi j(N-k)/N) = 2 \cos(2\pi jk/N),
\]
\[
\sin(2\pi jk/N) - \sin(2\pi j(N-k)/N) = 2 \sin(2\pi jk/N).

Then using \( \hat{y}_{N-k} = \overline{\hat{y}_k} \), we get

sta-1,93,"Let \( X \) be the outcome of the die toss, so \( X \) can take values \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \) with equal probability \( \frac{1}{6} \). Let \( Y \) be the number of heads obtained when tossing \( n \) coins. The probability of getting exactly two heads when tossing \( n \) coins is given by the binomial distribution: \( P(Y = 2 \mid X = n) = \binom{n}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \). 

We want to find the probability of getting exactly two heads, which is \( P(Y = 2) = \sum_{n=1}^6 P(Y = 2 \mid X = n) P(X = n) = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{n=1}^6 \binom{n}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n \).

We compute the sum:

\[
\frac{1}{6} \left[ \binom{2}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \binom{3}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + \binom{4}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^4 + \binom{5}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5 + \binom{6}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^6 \right]

Therefore, the probability of exactly two heads is close to 0.2578.
","\textit{Solution:} Let \( U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_6 \) denote the events ""uppermost 1, 2, \ldots, 6"" respectively and \( A \) denote the event in question. We have \( P(U_1) = \cdots = P(U_6) = \frac{1}{6} \). The formula of total probability gives

\[
P(A) = P(A \mid U_1) P(U_1) + P(A \mid U_2) P(U_2) + \cdots + P(A \mid U_6) P(U_6) = \frac{1}{6} \left( P(A \mid U_1) + \cdots + P(A \mid U_6) \right).
\]

Obviously \( P(A \mid U_1) = 0 \) holds. For the remaining conditional probabilities, considering 'Head' as a success and 'Tail' as a failure, we need to get the probability of two successes out of \( i \) independent Bernoulli trials by calculating the ratio
\[
\frac{\text{favourable outcomes}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}.
\]
The total number of outcomes is \( 2^i \) and the favourable ones are \( \binom{i}{2} \), that is, \( P(A \mid U_i) = \frac{\binom{i}{2}}{2^i},\ i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). Hence we get

\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 0 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{6}{16} + \frac{20}{64} + \frac{30}{128} \right) = \frac{33}{128} \approx 0.2578.

\[\frac{\partial\log L}{\partial\theta}=-\frac{1}{2\theta}+\frac{1}{2\theta^{2}} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\log x_{i})^{2}=0\]

Solving for \(\theta\),

\[\theta=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\log x_{i})^{2}\]

Thus, the MLE of \(\theta\) is \(\hat{\theta}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\log X_{i})^{2}\).

To check for unbiasedness, we have:

\[E(\hat{\theta})=E\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\log X_{i})^{2}\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}E[(\log X_{i})^{2}]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\theta=\frac{n\theta }{n}=\theta\]

Setting the score equal to zero (to find a stationary point) and solving the equation w.r. \(\theta\) we get the MLE

\[\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\log(x_i))^2}{n}.\]

This stationary point indeed delivers a maximum of the log-likelihood as calculating the second partial derivative at it we get

\[f_{Y,Z}(y,z)=f_{X_{(1)},X_{(n)}}(yz,z)|z|=n(n-1)\frac{1}{\theta^{n}}\left(\frac{z -yz}{\theta}\right)^{n-2}z=n(n-1)\frac{z^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}(1-y)^{n-2}\]

for \(0\leq y\leq 1\) and \(0\leq z\leq\theta\).

The marginal density of \(Y\) is

\[f_{Y}(y)=\int_{0}^{\theta}n(n-1)^{2}\frac{z^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}(1-y)^{n-2}dz=n(n -1)(1-y)^{n-2}\frac{1}{\theta^{n}}\frac{\theta^{n}}{n}=(n-1)(1-y)^{n-2}\]

for \(0\leq y\leq 1\).

The marginal density of \(Z\) is

\[f_{Z}(z)=\int_{0}^{1}n(n-1)^{2}\frac{z^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}(1-y)^{n-2}dy=n(n-1)^{2}\frac{z^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}\left[-\frac{(1-y)^{n-1}}{n-1}\right]_{0}^{1}=n\frac {z^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}\]

for \(0\leq z\leq\theta\).

Since \(f_{Y,Z}(y,z)=f_{Y}(y)f_{Z}(z)\), \(Y\) and \(Z\) are independent.

Therefore, \(X_{(1)}/X_{(n)}\) and \(X_{(n)}\) are independent.","d) We need to find the joint density first. Then we will be using a density transformation formula where one of the transformations is \(X_{(1)}/X_{(n)}\) and the other one is kept as \(X_{(n)}\). Note that for the uniform in \((0,\theta)\) random variable we have the density \(f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{\theta}\) when \(x\in(0,\theta)\) (and zero else). The cdf is \(F_{X}(x)=\frac{2}{\theta}\) when \(x\in(0,\theta)\) (and it is a constant \(0\) when \(x\leq 0\) and a constant \(1\) when \(x\geq\theta\)). The joint density of \(X_{(1)},X_{(n)}\) is given by

\[f_{X_{(1)},X_{(n)}}(x,y)=\frac{n!}{0!(n-2)00}\frac{1}{\theta}\frac{1}{\theta} \left[\frac{y-x}{\theta}\right]^{n-2}=\frac{(n-1)n}{\theta^{n}}(y-x)^{n-2},0<x <y<\theta.\]

Now introduce \(U=X_{(1)}/X_{(n)},V=X_{(n)}.\) Then \(X_{(1)}=UV,x_{(n)}=V\) holds. The constraints \(0<X_{(1)}<X_{(n)}<\theta\) transform into \(0<U<1<\frac{\theta}{\theta}.\) The Jacobian of the transformation \(X_{(1)}=UV,X_{(n)}=V\) is equal to V. Hence the joint density \(f_{UV}(u,v)\) is given by

\[f_{UV}(u,v)=f_{X_{(1)},X_{(n)}}(uv,v)\times v=\frac{(n-1)n}{\theta^{n}}(v-uv)^{n-2}v=\frac{(n-1)n}{\theta^{n}}v^{n-1}(1-u)^{n-2},0<u<1,0<v<\theta.\]

Now, the marginal density of \(V=X_{(n)}\) is of course \(f_{V}(v)=\frac{d}{dv}F_{V}(v)=\frac{d}{dv}(v/\theta)^{n}=\frac{mv^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}.\) Hence we have that the conditional density

\[f_{UV}(u\mid v)=f_{UV}(u,v)/f_{V}(v)=(n-1)(1-u)^{n-2},0<u<1\]

does not depend on the condition (only depends on \(u\)) which implies that \(U\) and \(V\) are independent. Alternatively, you could have calculated the marginal density of \(U\), as well. For this you integrate out the unwanted variable from the joint:

\[f_{U}(u)=\int_{0}^{\theta}\frac{(n-1)n}{\theta^{n}}v^{n-1}(1-u)^{n-2}dv=(1-u)^{n -2}\frac{(n-1)n}{\theta^{n}}\int_{0}^{\theta}v^{n-1}dv=(n-1)(1-u)^{n-2},\]

which implies that the joint density \(f_{UV}(u,v)\) is a product of the two marginals:

\[f_{UV}(u,v)=\frac{mv^{n-1}}{\theta^{n}}\times(n-1)(1-u)^{n-2}.\]

Hence \(U\) and \(V\) are independent.",5,no

Solving the equation of \( V(\mathbf{X}, \theta) = 0 \) gives the MLE as \( \hat{\theta} = \frac{-n}{\sum_{i=1}^n \log(X_i)} - 1 \). As \( h(\theta) = \frac{1}{1 + \theta} \), we can get the MLE \( \hat{h} \) by substituting \( \hat{\theta} \) for \( \theta \) in the formula for \( h \) (due to the invariance property of the MLE). We get then \( \hat{h} = \frac{-n}{\sum_{i=1}^n \log(X_i)} \).

We can argue about unbiasedness as follows. First we have
\[
\mathbb{E}(\log X_1) = \int_0^1 \log(x)(1 + \theta)x^\theta dx = \int_0^1 \log(x) dx^{\theta + 1}.

We can integrate by parts by noticing that
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \log(x)x^{\theta + 1} = 0

For $X_{(2)}$ where $n = 4$ and $k = 2$, we have:

for $0 < x < y < \infty$. Now we apply the density transformation formula with

\[
U = \frac{1}{2}(X_{(1)} + X_{(4)}) \qquad \text{and} \qquad V = X_{(1)}.
\]

This can equivalently be written as

\[
X_{(1)} = V \qquad \text{and} \qquad X_{(4)} = 2U - V.

The value of the Jacobian of this transformation is equal to $-2$ since:

\[
J(u, v) = \left| \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} \atop \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} \right| = \left| \begin{matrix} 0 & 1 \\ 2 & -1 \end{matrix} \right| = 0 \times -1 - 2 \times 1 = -2

Therefore the absolute value of the Jacobian is equal to two. Using the density transformation formula we have:

\[
