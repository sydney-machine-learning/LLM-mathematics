Problemfour,"The Premier of NSW has to take an important decision whether or not to include an additional line (extension) to Sydney’s metro system. The decision is based on the financial viability of the extension. He is willing to apply decision theory in making his decision. He uses the independent opinion of two consulting experts.

When a project is financially viable, both experts have correctly predicted its viability with probability 4/5 (and wrongly with 1/5). When a project has not been financially viable, both experts had a prediction of 3/5 for it to be viable.
